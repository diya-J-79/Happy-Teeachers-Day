    <h1><span>Dearest Teachers, 

You greet us every morning with a warm smile on your face 

Even though sometimes finishing work can become a race 

You teach us with humour and patience 

And answer all our questions 

You treat every one of us with the same amount of dedication 

You work hard everyday 

Make our fears go away 

You teach us the difference between wrong and right 

You teach us to be helpful, caring and wise 

You help us understand that no matter how dark the night 

The sun will always rise 

In our lives you make a big impact 

We must remember that 

For the dawn of each author, each doctor or king 

Begins with a teacher and the wisdom they bring 

 

Love and a ton of gratitude,
