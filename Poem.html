    <h1><span>Dearest Teachers, <br>

You greet us every morning with a warm smile on your face <br>

Even though sometimes finishing work can become a race <br>

You teach us with humour and patience <br>

And answer all our questions <br>

You treat every one of us with the same amount of dedication <br>

You work hard everyday <br>

Make our fears go away <br>

You teach us the difference between wrong and right <br>

You teach us to be helpful, caring and wise <br>

You help us understand that no matter how dark the night <br>

The sun will always rise <br>

In our lives you make a big impact <br>

We must remember that <br>

For the dawn of each author, each doctor or king <br>

Begins with a teacher and the wisdom they bring <br>

 

Love and a ton of gratitude, <br><br>
