    <h1><span>Hello everyone! <br>I'm Diya Joshi but my friends call me DJ! I recently joined Podar international and to be honest, <br>I was scared, not because I didn't have the courage to shift schools but because I was scared that everyone would ignore me.<br> I was scared that in an online platform I would never make friends, what if the teachers shout at me? These scary possibilities would dance around my mind. But am I glad to say that just a few hours into my very first <br>lecture all those worries disappeared.<br> Everone was just so nice and friendly! All the teachers would be ready to help me out at anytime of the day. Really, ANYTIME.<br> Once I was stuck on a problem in maths and Jamie ma'am immeadietly helped me, even though it was already 10:00 in the night.<br> I also wanted to thank Nikita ma'am for being so helpfull and freindly. <br>It's always fun when Nikita ma'am is around!</span></h1>
