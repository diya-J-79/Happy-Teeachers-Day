Really, ANYTIME.<br> Once I was stuck on a problem in maths and Jamie ma'am immeadietly helped me, even though it was already 10:00 in the night.<br> I also wanted to thank Nikita ma'am for being so helpfull and freindly. <br>It's always fun when Nikita ma'am is around!</span></h1>
    <h1></span><br>Good morning.

    <h1><br>on one monday morning in the second grade, a child tried to bully me but i bullied him before that because i didnt want to get hurt, the teacher caught me and taught me not to bully others, but to complain to the teacher</span>. - Arsh</span></h1>
    <h1><br> When i first came to school in 1st grade i used to be scared that what will happen no one will like me but all the teachers made it such a comfortable space for us more likely like our 2nd home.When ever i was sick the teachers always took care of me. i have made some amazing memories at podar and continue to make some more - Saisha</span>.</span></h1>
